\title{Compute MST based on the initial clustering assignment}
\usage{
compute_MST_spatial(
  data,
  coords_cols = c("x", "y"),
  cluster_col = "cluster",
  bnd = NULL,
  threshold = 5000,
  penalty = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least coordinate columns and a clustering column.}

\item{coords_cols}{Character vector of length 2 specifying the coordinate column names (default: \code{c("x", "y")}).}

\item{cluster_col}{Character string specifying the name of the column with the initial cluster membership (default: \code{"cluster"}).}

\item{bnd}{A list with elements \code{x} and \code{y} representing the boundary. If \code{NULL} (default), the convex hull of the points is used.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value for the maximum allowable edge length in \code{constrainedDentri} (default: 5000).}

\item{penalty}{Numeric penalty added to inter-cluster edges. If \code{NULL} (default), it is set to \code{max(edge weight) + 1}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{mst}{The MST as an igraph object (with all points connected).}
\item{data}{The original data frame augmented with a new column \code{spatial_cluster} containing the spatial component membership for each point.}
}
\description{
#' This function computes a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a set of points with
an initial clustering assignment. It penalizes edges that connect points from different
clusters, computes the MST on the penalized graph, and then identifies spatial components
(i.e., disconnected subgraphs) within each cluster. The output is a list containing the MST
(as an igraph object) and the input data frame augmented with a new column, \code{spatial_cluster},
that gives the spatial component membership for each point.
