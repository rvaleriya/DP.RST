\title{Select Optimal Partition from DP-RST Output}
\usage{
partition(DP.RST_output, method = "mode_based", batch_size = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{DP.RST_output}{A list containing the output from \code{DP.RST()}.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the method for selecting the optimal partition:
\describe{
\item{\code{"mode_based"}}{Selects a partition from iterations with the most common number
of "teams", minimizing Frobenius distance to the mean within that mode. This is
the default method.}
\item{\code{"frobenius"}}{Selects the partition closest to the posterior similarity matrix
across all iterations, as measured by Frobenius norm.}
\item{\code{"binder"}}{Minimizes Binder's loss function against the posterior similarity
matrix, which often better represents the central tendency of the posterior.}
\item{\code{"posterior_mode"}}{Selects the iteration with the highest marginal likelihood
value, if available.}
}}

\item{batch_size}{Integer specifying the number of iterations to process in each batch.
Larger values may increase speed but require more memory. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A list containing the selected partition:
\describe{
\item{\code{groups_partition}}{Vector of group assignments from the selected iteration.}
\item{\code{teams_partition}}{Vector of refined team assignments from the selected iteration.}
\item{\code{selected_iteration}}{Index of the selected iteration.}
}
}
\description{
This function selects an optimal partition from the posterior samples of a
Dirichlet Process Random Spanning Tree (DP-RST) model using various methods
to summarize the posterior distribution of partitions.
