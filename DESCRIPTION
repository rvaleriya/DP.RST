Description: Implements a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework for clustering 
    spatial transcriptomics data that can detect an unknown number of clusters 
    in complex spatial domains. The method uses a two-layer partitioning 
    approach: the first layer employs random spanning trees to create spatial 
    partitions that respect tissue boundaries and capture irregular cluster shapes, 
    while the second layer uses a Dirichlet process mixture model to refine these 
    partitions by grouping spatially distant regions with similar gene expression 
    profiles. Includes utilities for clustering, visualization, 
  and posterior inference.
